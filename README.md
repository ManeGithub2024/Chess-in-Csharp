"Chess in C#" Console Application is a program that will allow two players to play a game of chess using a text-based interface in the console. The application will feature a visual representation of the chessboard, handle player move input with validation according to the rules of chess, and potentially include basic mechanisms for checking for check and checkmate. The application will be developed using an object-oriented approach, where each chess piece is represented by a separate class with its own movement logic.
