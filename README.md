"Chess in C#" Console Application is a program that will allow two players to play a game of chess using a text-based interface in the console. The application will feature a visual representation of the chessboard, handle player move input with validation according to the rules of chess, and potentially include basic mechanisms for checking for check and checkmate. The application will be developed using an object-oriented approach, where each chess piece is represented by a separate class with its own movement logic.

The implementation needs to cover two main scenarios:
1 - Detecting a Check: After the current player makes a move, we need to determine if the opponent's king is now in check.
2 - Preventing Self-Check on Capture: When the king captures an opponent's piece, we must ensure that the resulting position does not leave the king in check.
